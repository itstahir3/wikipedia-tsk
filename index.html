    <p><h1>BODY BUILDING</h1></p>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic
        purposes.[1] An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.</p> <img src="220px-Arnold_Schwarzenegger_1974.jpg">

        <p> In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines)
        for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and
        conditioning. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced
        at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbohydrate loading, to achieve maximum
        muscular definition and vascularity, as well as tanning to accentuate the contrast of the skin under the
        spotlights. Bodybuilders may use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Body Builder use three main stratigies to maximize muscle hypertrophy</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training">Strength training</a> through weights or
                elastic/hydraulic
                resistance.</li>
            <li>Specialist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"> Nutrition </a>incorporating extra <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"> Protien </a> and supplements when necessary</li>
            <li>Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Bodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto "eat clean, train hard, sleep well".</p><br>
